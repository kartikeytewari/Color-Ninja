# Color-Ninja
The place to become the next Color Ninja

Amid the pandemic of coronavirus-19, here's a fun game for you. This is the Color Ninja game, for the bored folks. The game will give you three numbers from 1 to 100 each of red, green and blue pigments. When you add these pigments a color will be made. It is one of the colors that you see in the tiles. Choose it in as less choice as you can, and you get a score. The player with the highest score wins the game. The software is presently in alpha testing. Feel free to ping the developer for any bugs or features!
